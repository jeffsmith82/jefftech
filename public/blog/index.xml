      <description>So I thought it is about time I started blogging. I hear it is a good way to force yourself to properly learn new things by trying to explain them to others.
So the first thing i want to learn is Time. Specifically how the programming lanagauge deals with time. So you could say its Go Time.
What is time What exactly is time. Usually I go to wikipedia and see what it says.</description>

      <description>I have read alot about C++ recently as I have been involved in trying to port a medium sized collection of c++ apps from Windows to Linux. From everything I have read there are two types of c++ code, pre c++11 and post c++11 which everyone seems to refer to as modern c++. From what i have found this is partially true.
My normal roll is team lead for our cloud team so I spend a fair bit of time on a Linux command line, in fact im writing this blog post in vim :-) so porting something from windows to Linux would make my life easier as Linux is much easier to manage then windows so thought i would pitch in.</description>
